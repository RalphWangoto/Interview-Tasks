Overview
This is a scalable and modular Cypress automation framework designed for end-to-end (E2E) testing of web applications. It follows best practices by separating test specs, reusable page modules, utilities, and configurations, ensuring maintainability and efficiency.
The framework supports UI and API testing, organizes test cases by modules and submodules, and includes custom commands, fixtures, and plugins for optimized automation.

---------
Running Tests:

ðŸ”¹ Run all UI tests:

    npx cypress run --spec 'cypress/e2e/**/*.js'

ðŸ”¹ Run a specific UI test:

    npx cypress run --spec "'cypress/e2e/**/{fileName}.js'

ðŸ”¹ Run Cypress in interactive mode:

    npx cypress open

ðŸ”¹ Run API tests only:

    npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/**/*.api.cy.js"

--------
Configuration

Cypress Configuration

    All global settings can be found in cypress.config.js. Modify it as needed.

Environment Variables

    Sensitive data or environment-specific configurations should be stored in cypress.env.json:

-------
Reporting
Test execution results are automatically stored in the reports/ directory.
To generate a detailed report, run:

npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome
We also have a cypress custom report (Main report for this project) that reads data from the mochawesome .json report. Use the following command after test is run to completion to generate a custom-report.html

node generate-custom-report.js
